    "# Generating all cones from the maximal ones\n",

    "The secondary fan on $\\operatorname{TGr}_{0}(3,8)$ given to us was a list of rays and maximal cones (up to $\\mathfrak{S}_8$--symmetry). In this notebook, we generate the remaining cones. Here is a sketch.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a note on the lineality space $L_{\\mathbb{R}}$. Each ray $r + L_{\\mathbb{R}}$ of  $\\operatorname{TGr}^{\\circ}(3,8)$ has a unique primitive integral generator in $L_{\\mathbb{R}}^{\\perp}$. Working with these representatives, we may safely ignore the lineality space. \n",

    "Denote the set of $k$-codimensional cones up to $\\mathfrak{S}_8$ symmetry by $\\mathcal{C}_k$. Given $\\mathcal{C}_k$, we want to determine $\\mathcal{C}_{k+1}$. First, find all facets of all cones in $\\mathcal{C}_k$. This set contains at least one representative from each $\\mathfrak{S}_8$-orbit of the $(k+1)$-codimensional cones; we need to find a *unique* representative for each orbit.  For each facet $F$, form the vector $v_F$ by taking the sum of all generating rays, then take the unique primitive generator of this ray. Note that two cones $F,F'$ are equal iff $v_F = v_{F'}$. We use this data to find the unique representatives, and hence form $\\mathcal{C}_{k+1}$. "
