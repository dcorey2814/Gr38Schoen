# Gr38Schoen
Code used in the paper "The Grassmannian of 3-planes in C^8 is schoen" by Daniel Corey and Dante Luber.

The notebooks ```G2.ipynb```, ```G3.ipynb```, ```G4.ipynb```, ```G5.ipynb```, ```G6.ipynb``` contain the code used in the proof of Propositions 6.7, 6.13, 6.14, 6.16, and 6.19, respectively. These rely on the functions in the files contained in the ```src``` directory. The documentation for these functions is in the notebook ```functionDocumentation.ipynb```.

This code works with OSCAR version 0.9.0.
